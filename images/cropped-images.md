# Image Optimization

### Start the Project

* [ ] `cd` into the theme folder in terminal.
* [ ] Run `theme watch` from the **main theme folder**
* [ ] Run `gulp watch` from the **dev** folder

### Export images from the Design

* [ ] **Export** all images from Sketch or XD. 
  * Export for **web at 2x**.  
  * For vector images that need to stay crisp at all sizes \(logos, etc.\) export as .svg
  * For any images that don't need transparency, use .jpg/.jpeg file format. 
  * For images that need transparency export as .png
* [ ] **Save all images** to the **`dev/images_for_shopify`** 
* [ ] Images will auto-optimize if gulp is running. **Drag and drop the optimized images to a folder** on your computer outside the project folder so they are ready when they need to be uploaded as you build out the site.
